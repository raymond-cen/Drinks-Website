22,Cosmopolitan,"The Cosmo was a product of its time. In the late-1980s and early-’90s, vodka was king, but flavored vodka was just finding an audience. When Absolut released its first flavored vodka, the lemony Citron, bartenders had a new toy to work with. Cecchini used it in the Cosmo alongside Ocean Spray, and the vodka-and-cranberry duo is still the preferred pair at most bars today.

The Manhattan’s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, enlivened with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty—the very definition of what a cocktail should be. Rye's spicier, edgier profile makes it a better choice in this cocktail than bourbon, but really, you can go with whichever you prefer. And while Angostura bitters are a must in any variation, a single dash of orange bitters helps brighten the cocktail’s edges, bringing the whiskey and vermouth together seamlessly, while the brandied cherry garnish lends a touch of sweetness.","Add bitters, Sweet Vermouth and bourbon into a mixing glass | Add ice to the top and stir continuously | Strain into a chilled coupe | Garnish with a cherry and enjoy",,

33,Clover Club,"The Clover Club with gin, fresh lemon juice, raspberry syrup and egg white was a favorite among this genteel set.

36,Mint Julep,"The Mint Julep is traditionally served in a rocks glass or, ideally, in a silver julep cup. Since bourbon is the only liquid in the drink, you’ll want to use a high-quality bottle that you know you love. A slightly higher-proof bourbon—something in the mid-80s or around 90—will keep the crushed ice from diluting the cocktail too quickly",Soak sugar/ a sugar cube in angostura bitters and muddle in a julep tin with a bit of soda water | Smash mint leaves in your hands and add it to the glass | Add your bourbon to the glass | Fill the glass with crushed ice and churn the contents until the mint is dispered throughout the drink | Garnish with a mint sprig and a straw,,

39,B52,"The B-52 is a popular, eye-catching shot composed of three liqueurs: Baileys Irish cream, Grand Marnier and coffee liqueur.
